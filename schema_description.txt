provide a database schema describing how you would store the retrieved temperature and weather conditions for each city in a relational database.

The schema of the database would depend on what we want to do with the data, but for the purposes of this assignment, I will assume that we just want to record all calls made to the system, filterable by city.

-------------------------------
all_calls
-------------------------------
id (PK)			number
city_and_country 	varchar
time_of_call		timestamp
temperature_OWM		number
temperature_DS		number
condition_OWM		varchar
condition_DS		varchar
details_OWM		varchar
-------------------------------

If more information were to be saved (as there is a lot more available from the APIs), more tables could be used. Additionally, support for lookup by a city ID could be added, and then a city_id table could be used as a mapping.
